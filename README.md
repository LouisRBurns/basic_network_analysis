# Network Science Lesson Example
### Executive Summary
For an instructor interview, I needed to do a teaching lesson of a topic that interests me. I didn't want to use any of the content from the data science boot camps I participated in or taught to avoid any intellectual property claims. 

Being a student of network science, I studied network analysis through DataCamp, read the documentation, played around with Python and networkx, and created my own lesson and walk through code in Jupyter Lab. For the life of me, I don't understand why virtually all boot camps skip over network analysis.

The accompanying lesson and coding walk through are here:
